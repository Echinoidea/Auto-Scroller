# Auto-Scroller
Made by Gabriel Hooks on 2020-08-25

A simple Python script to simulate mouse scrolling (very quickly) in either direction. I made this to use in Minecraft.

To run the script, run AutoScroller.exe in the dist folder.
Press Page Up or Page Down to start/pause auto scrolling up or down respectively and press END to terminate the program.
